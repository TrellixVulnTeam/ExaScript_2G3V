      <p>ExaScript - A scripting/programming language maintained by ExaPhaser!
Syntax and language base is Python 3 -- All Python 3 code constructs are available.</p>

<p>ExaScript uses the .ESC file extension for console scripts and modules,
and the .ESCW for Windows applications. ExaScript also has a 64-bit
version from IronPython, though not fully compatiable.</p>

<p><em>MOST</em> Python 3 standard libraries are supported--however, they are not
necessary because ExaScript runs on the .NET Framework 4.0, and is compatiable
with all of the standard Microsoft libraries included in .NET 4.0.</p>

<p>Additionally, ExaScript's standard library includes a variety of helper
classes, greatly simplifying functionality for people new to programming,
and still providing more complex APIs for more advanced usage.</p>

<p>The ExaScript standard library is also maintained by ExaPhaser, and receives
frequent updates that add newer libraries written in C#. All of these
libraries are available on GitHub, and their wrapper .ESC files in the
'Lib' folder that contains the standard library all contain links
to the documentation and source code of the libraries.</p>

<p>Points of interest:</p>

<ul>
<li>ExaScript contains multiple libraries ported from OmniBean;
these include PowerCrypt4, OmniBeanLib, and OmniBeanEB.</li>
<li><p>Anyone experienced or used to Small Basic, a programming
language for beginners, can port almost all Small Basic
code directly to ExaScript by copying and pasting with
very few minor edits, as ExaScript comes with OmniBeanEB,
a <a href="https://github.com/exaphaser/OmniBeanEB">completely open-source full rewrite of the Small Basic Library</a></p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, anyone who can program
Small Basic and has just a superficial knowledge of
Python syntax can write their programs in ExaScript,
a much more extensible and powerful language with full
support for extensions in any .NET Language.</p></li>
</ul>
