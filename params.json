{"name":"Exascript","tagline":"ExaScript - .NET and Python [derivation IronLanguages/IronPython3]","body":"ExaScript - A scripting/programming language maintained by ExaPhaser!\r\nSyntax and language base is Python 3 -- All Python 3 code constructs are available.\r\n\r\nExaScript uses the .ESC file extension for console scripts and modules,\r\nand the .ESCW for Windows applications. ExaScript also has a 64-bit\r\nversion from IronPython, though not fully compatiable.\r\n\r\n*MOST* Python 3 standard libraries are supported--however, they are not\r\nnecessary because ExaScript runs on the .NET Framework 4.0, and is compatiable\r\nwith all of the standard Microsoft libraries included in .NET 4.0.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ExaScript's standard library includes a variety of helper\r\nclasses, greatly simplifying functionality for people new to programming,\r\nand still providing more complex APIs for more advanced usage.\r\n\r\nThe ExaScript standard library is also maintained by ExaPhaser, and receives\r\nfrequent updates that add newer libraries written in C#. All of these\r\nlibraries are available on GitHub, and their wrapper .ESC files in the\r\n'Lib' folder that contains the standard library all contain links\r\nto the documentation and source code of the libraries.\r\n\r\nPoints of interest:\r\n- ExaScript contains multiple libraries ported from OmniBean;\r\nthese include PowerCrypt4, OmniBeanLib, and OmniBeanEB.\r\n- Anyone experienced or used to Small Basic, a programming\r\nlanguage for beginners, can port almost all Small Basic\r\ncode directly to ExaScript by copying and pasting with\r\nvery few minor edits, as ExaScript comes with OmniBeanEB,\r\na [completely open-source full rewrite of the Small Basic Library]\r\n(https://github.com/exaphaser/OmniBeanEB)\r\n\r\n- Therefore, anyone who can program\r\nSmall Basic and has just a superficial knowledge of\r\nPython syntax can write their programs in ExaScript,\r\na much more extensible and powerful language with full\r\nsupport for extensions in any .NET Language.\r\n\r\n--ExaPhaser Alpha\r\nOctober 26, 2015\r\n\r\nBrought to you by the ExaPhaser Team.\r\n\r\nLook in releases for the latest binaries with the latest standard library.\r\n\r\nThis project is based on IronLanguages/IronPython3\r\n\r\nExaScript is a customized version; contact ExaPhaser\r\nfor any issues.\r\nCopyright (c) ExaPhaser 2015.
